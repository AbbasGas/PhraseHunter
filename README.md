<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Phrase Hunter Demo Screenshot][product-screenshot]](https://www.othneildrew.com/PhraseHunter)

Phrase Hunter is a browser-based word guessing game that is part of [Treehouse's Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree](https://join.teamtreehouse.com/full-stack-javascript-techdegree). This project uses JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to generate a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess before running out of hearts.

**It works with both the on-screen and physical keyboard.**
